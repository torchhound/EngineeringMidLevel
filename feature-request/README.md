# feature-request

## Features

- [ ] *User Management*. A system that holds client feature requests benefits greatly from user management. Some projects include admin controlled user accounts. Better projects included self enrollment via email. The best projects used a SSO solution like OAuth or SAML.

- [ ] *Client / Project Management*. As a base requirement, you had a fixed list of clients and projects, but the best projects included a simple admin interface associated with the admin login that gives users a basic CRUD interface for these entities.

- [ ] *Filter by Client*. If multiple clients are submitting feature requests, it is important to be able to view the total task list as well as a list filtered by client.

- [ ] *Sorting*. This one is very important if you've ever worked on a real project and managed client priorities. Decent projects deploy unique sort rank per client. Better projects include sorting per client AND whole all client sorting. The best projects do all of this utilizing a drag and drop component bound to the MVVM framework.

- [ ] *Discussion Threads*. A few projects go far enough to include discussion threads within each feature request and one has even included push notifications utilizing SMS.

- [ ] *Unit Tests* 

- [ ] *Continuous Integration*

- [ ] *Automated Deployment*
